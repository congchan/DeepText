## Deep Learning for Text
Deep learning could help to process text for various purposes, say, text classification, tagging, text summarization, keywords extraction, and text clustering etc.. These NLP tasks cover a large fraction of NLP application domains.  

Most of these tasks are essentially classification problem or clustering problem, which could be handled with (multinomial) logistic regression model, and sequence-to-sequence(seq2seq) architecture.

This package aims to handle most of these tasks using deep learning models with a unitfied and cleaned API.
